        <p>Hi! My name is <span class="text-var2">Chaymae</span>, I'm a <span class="text-var1">Software</span> Engineer with a particular passion for backend.
        I am a <span class="text-var1">Rubyist</span> at heart, and I’ve recently developed an interest in Rust.</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts about me :</p>
        <ul class="intro">
          <li>
            I love mathematics! My dad is a math teacher. We often use some math term in our jokes, that's why they are not so funny to others.
          </li>
          <li>
            My meme driven good mood is very infectious!
          </li>
          <li>
            I believe that every great piece of code deserves an equally great meme to go with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            I speak Arabic, English and French fluently. I can also understand basic Danish.
          </li>
          <li>
            I love to do pixel art.
          </li>
          <li>
            I like to engage with differnet ruby communities.
          </li>

            <li><strong>Zendesk - Copenhagen</strong>
              <ul>

                  <strong>Software Engineer</strong><br />
                  <weak>Apr 2021 - Mar 2023</weak>
                  <p>Zendesk is the champion of customer service solutions. It powers
                  billions of conversations, connecting brands with customers over
                  telephony, chat, email, messaging, social channels, ... etc.</p>
                  <p>I've been a member of the core ruby team, working on core products. I also worked a lot with other teams, making sure we are not having redundant
                      services across teams.
                    I took part in DB Sharding solutions. Using a mix of ULIDs and Znowflake for ID generation depending on the usecase.
                    I also enjoyed organizing fun Friday games for the team.</p>

                  <p>Karnov provides tools for lawyers to make faster and better decisions.
                  They also have a huge selection of books.</p>
                  <p>Digitalising law book is challenging. I took part in big room plannings with product managers and product
                      owners. I have been involved in developing a new CMS system, also improving the existing system.</p>

                  <weak>Oct 2018 - Jan 2020</weak>
                  <p>CargoFlux is a plateform where users can keep track of their shipments.
                  It provides a unified API that adapt third party legacy systems to an agnostic JSON API system.
                  One of the challenges I came across was to design and build an EDIFACT parser to communicate data via FTP servers with
                  certain shipping carriers. And to implement integrations with different shipping carriers (e.g: DHL, GLS ...).</p>

                  <p>MonMecanicien is a platform where users can get an invoice for car repair and book appointments with trusted mechanics.
                  In there I worked directly with the CTO.
                  I was in charge of developing full features from backend to frontend as in the specifications,
                  also built the entire mobile app for mechanics using React native.</p>
